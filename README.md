### Contents of this repository

* The file `logistic_regression.ipynb` contains the step-by-step development and application of a logistic regression model to a binary classification problem. A couple of interesting data generation algorithms are introduced as a by-product.
* The `net/` directory contains the code defining the extendable neural network model, the majority of which can be found in `layers.py` and `network.py`. The file `utils.py` contains utility functions which can be used to assist with the preparation of data and training of models. The remaining files contain applications of various models to assorted problems.
* The `data/` directory is used to store NumPy-format data files used in the KMNIST examples - see the separate README file in that directory for more information.
* The `report/` directory contains the final paper in PDF format, as well as the TeX source code, accompanying figures (as generated by the code in `net/`), and project specification.
